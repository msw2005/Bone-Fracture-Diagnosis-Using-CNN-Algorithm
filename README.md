About
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for medical image analysis and diagnosis. It is designed to assist healthcare professionals by automating the detection and classification of medical images, potentially improving accuracy and efficiency in diagnostics. The code is written entirely in Python.

Features
Implementation of CNN architectures tailored for medical image data

Support for preprocessing and augmentation of medical images

Training, validation, and testing pipeline for image classification

Easily extensible and modifiable for different medical imaging datasets

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Common libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on implementation)

NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, or Pillow for image processing

Jupyter Notebook or IDE for running experiments
