The dataset used for this code can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/bone-fracture-detection-using-xrays. 

This collection contains x-ray pictures of several joints that are fractured and non-fractured. The goal is to create an image classifier that can detect fractures in an x-ray image. This dataset contains many joints in the upper extremities; individual joint isolation is recommended for improved classifier performance.

To run the code in the file please change the path of 'train_generator' and 'val_generator' to the location of train folder and val folder within the archive folder when you download the dataset from the link.
At lines 11 and 19 respectively in the python file.
In the code, currently the paths are set the the path of those folders in my computer.

Thanks.
